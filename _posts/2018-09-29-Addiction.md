## What can be called addiction?

I got loads of things to handle right now, and my eyes can’t literately open, but I just can’t stop writing this article right now. __This is addiction.__

### How does this addiction happen? 
First, I have a strong desire to finish this article once I started. Then I will to anything to achieve this because I can get really high when I saw this on my blog. __That’s the reward__
![pathway](https:/ScarlettXuH.github.io/img/post-02-01.png)
When the cortex has received and processed a sensory stimulus indicating a __reward__, it sends a signal announcing this reward to a particular part of the midbrain–the ventral tegmental area __(VTA)–whose activity then increases.__ The VTA then releases __dopamine__ not only into the __nucleus accumbens__, but also into the _prefrontal cortex_.

The nucleus accumbens then activates the individual’s motor functions, while the prefrontal cortex focuses his or her attention.

## What is Delta-FosB?
A short definement of DeltaFosB is a sustained molecular switch for addiction.
The addictive drugs (coke, heroin, etc.) were addictive because of their effects on the brain's dopamine pathways. 
Too much dopamine can override our natural satiation mechanism. Then Delta-FosB accumulates, which makes people craving for more drugs.

Perceptively, the user has to take more of that drug to feel euphoria as the degree of stimulation given by these drugs is unmatchable by a sober state.

## What are some changes it brings?

> - Numbed pleasure response
> - Hyper-reactivity to drugs
> - Willpower erosion

Here is the comparison of two groups of activation to the same stimuli.

We could find that abuser get less activation then the normal. That explains why they ask more stimuli for getting the same amount of pleasure.

## How to get rid of addictions?
It takes a long time to go away when Delta-FosB’s presence is jacked up into the stratosphere with drugs. But the good news is, it's not an incredibly durable enzyme.

Stress and irregular life have an established association with relapse and vulnerability to relapse. So we can not _Burn the candle at both ends_. How to banlance health and geting pleasure is a real article.

## P.S.

It's midnight roght now and I got plenty of Delta-FosB for sure. And the urge to get more dopamine hit me, pushing me to change the means to get high like finding something to eat. U know what? Cuz I know how this works, which makes possible to cut it off. Knowing about all of this is really cool! All I will do is to take a gooood rest to get rid of those Delta-FosB. Bonne nuit.
