### Why we want to show our life by social media?

When people are vulnerable, they attend to reach out for help somehow. They are more like to express their feelings, or they show the opposite feelings to cover the real thoughts.All sorts of emotions boil down to weakness.

### What kind of post are likely to get likes?

The most popular one in my posts is the announcement of last relationship, which acclaimed 75 likes. Followed by the pictures of myself in Dalian, just one less, really want to get one more to overstep that one.

People are interested in gossips and pictures. A good feed should include picture and explosive news. There’s one more key factor we can’t miss, the time we posted can affect the numbers in an unconceivable way. From my experience, 4-6pm is the perfect time, another peak is around 9pm. 

### Too much social life made me exhausted 
 
 Sometimes, I spent half an hour to edit a post, while it ends up less then 20 likes. I could call it a failure, and the time on checking new likes is worthless.
 
 I found that I get addicted to getting connected with others and put way too much energy on that. From commenting to waiting for reply, suddenly I felt something went wrong. I am not sure that I could get rid of this bad feeling by quitting browsing moments, but I definitely going to give it a try. I may miss something beautiful, but I could also get something peaceful. 

### I am going to get out of the trap by shutting moments

For some reason, I hit the like because they gave likes to me before, and I have the obligation to give them back. After all, everyone like the feeling when they get likes. But most of the cases, we don't remember who liked the post, we just care about the numbers. So it doesn't hurt if I don't contribute that number.

At first, I want to give a announcement to say goodbye on wechat. It was like 'So long, my friends. This is a post I am not going to reply.' But when I really don't care about that anymore, I would not bother to be that drama queen.

_Yours Sincerely_
